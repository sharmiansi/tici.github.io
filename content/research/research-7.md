In coded distributed matrix multiplication, a master node wishes to compute large-scale matrix product with the help of several worker nodes, we proposed a class of codes to deal with this type of matrix multiplication, called Squeezed Random Khatri-Rao Product (RKRP) codes. We showed that squeezed RKRP codes are MDS with probability 1, and have optimial recovery thresholds with probability 1.
