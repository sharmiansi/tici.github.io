## Vision

Connected intelligent systems, supported over NextG communication and distributed compute are key to the next societal transformation. These systems include edge/cloud-supported robotics, augmented reality/virtual reality, Chat/CodeBots based on large language models, and real time media, which promise to revolutionize logistics, manufacturing, infrastructure, healthcare, education, and entertainment. This revolution will critically depend on the three key innovation areas of    
(i) empirical and foundational work in machine learning,    
(ii) NextG wireless and compute systems, and    
(iii) sensing and communication systems with on-board intelligence. 

This initiative brings together faculty, students, and researchers across the Texas A&M University community to enable collaborative research and attain primacy in connected intelligent systems.
